            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No advertising, no campaigns, no emotions, no sympathy. The reason for your choice
            will not be advertising, campaigning, emotions, or sympathy, but <a href="/programs.html"
                class="link-dark"><strong><em>but the official pre-election program</em></strong></a> of each candidate
            for the President of Ukraine. Today, this is the only clue by which we can judge the plans of our elected
            officials. Today, this is the only work result that characterizes the future President. What he will do
            depends on how the President plans.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to offer you <em>to determine your President by means of a test</em>.
            Each question of the test is a field of activity or a problem that each candidate sees and solves in his own
            way. For each question, you need to choose the only answer that appeals to you the most. You may not find an
            acceptable answer and you have your own opinion. Then choose the most acceptable answer, and express your
            opinion in your personal election program at the next election. Each answer is a fact from <em>the
                Pre-Election Program</em> of a certain candidate. As a result, you will receive an objective rating of
            the candidates, depending on the identity of your views and the views of your electorate. The more points a
            particular candidate has, the more views you have gleaned from his Pre-Election Program.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When choosing an answer, pay attention to the little things. Every little thing is a
            reason. This is an opportunity. The future development of our country depends on it. Therefore, even a small
            difference in scores will lead to a big difference in the future. The homogeneity of all programs requires
            an appreciation of details. Demands to value your winners.
            No advertising, no campaigning, no emotions, no sympathy.
